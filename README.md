## Project: Classifying Tweets using a Naive Bayes Classifier

As part of a self-directed Codecademy certification, the purpose of this project is to use a Naive Bayes Classifier to find patterns in real tweets. 

The goal is to create a classification algorithm that can classify a tweet or sentence, and predict whether that sentence came from New York, London, or Paris.
